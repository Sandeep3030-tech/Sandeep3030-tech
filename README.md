## Hi there! Thanks for stopping by👋

I am currently pursuing a BSc (Hons) in Computer Science. My passion for technology started when I was a kid, wondering how computers could handle such complex tasks. Fast forward to today, I am thrilled to be at a point where I can make a computer follow my instructions to solve problems.
